                <div class="box2" id="textbox"><strong> Organ player, Nikolina: </strong></br><q> As a member of orchestra I gained most incredible experience during my education. In positive atmosphere, along with glassful of persistence, most challenging compositions did not present a problem. It is very particular sensation we show up on a stage and when others take their instruments in hands. This is when strong energy radiating and culmination start. Certainly, most beautiful feeling, not only in school but in life is thundering applause we receive once the gig ends.</q> </div>
                <div class="box2" id="textbox">Beside recording and making music videos orchestra is really successful with concert performance. In last sex years we visited over 10 differnt towns in Bosnia and Hercegovina and performed over 20 concerts. Here is one of them.  </div>

# This is a first project for udacity frontEnd nanodegree

###  About the website

Here I designed simple website with two pages for my first project purpose. 
Inside first page I made basic informarion about Gimnasium orkcestra from Trebinje. 
I used css grid and flexbox as well so I can arrange boxes properly. Website contains media breakpoints so it can be media responsive. I used different css files to style content because it is more easy to read.
